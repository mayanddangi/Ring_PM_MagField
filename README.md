# Ring Magnet Simulation with Magpylib

This repository contains Python code for simulating the magnetic field of ring magnets using the `magpylib` library. It offers several functionalities, including:

- Calculating the magnetic field at specific points.
- Generating 2D plots of magnetic field intensity.
- Plotting the magnetic field strength as a function of separation between two magnets.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher  
- `magpylib`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib` (for visualization)

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install magpylib numpy matplotlib
```

## Files

- **`ring_magnet_simulation.ipynb`**: The Python script containing the simulation code for simulating the magnetic field in the vicinity of single ring magnet.
- **`Helmholtz Ring Magnet.ipynb`**: The magnets have their axial direction along the z-axis. Two ring magnets are placed in a Helmholtz-like configuration in the x-y plane, and the Python notebook simulates the magnetic field in the x-z plane.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mayanddangi/Ring_PM_MagField.git
cd Ring_PM_MagField
```

The script will execute the simulation and generate plots of the magnetic field. The plots will be displayed in the notebook itself.
